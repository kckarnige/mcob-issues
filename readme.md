**This a modpack that aims to make Minecraft feel better, no matter how you prefer to play the game.**

This pack features mods like Better Combat, SimplySwords, SimplySkills, Vivecraft, Teralith, almost all of [YUNG's](https://modrinth.com/user/YUNGNICKYOUNG) worldgen mods, BetterNether, BetterEnd, Adorn, and a ton more.
